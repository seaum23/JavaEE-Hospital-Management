# JavaEE-Hospital-Management
This a hospital management website. The template was taken from "Colorlib". The backend part was done by me.
I used Java EE features for the backend and also tried to follow MVC structure. Data was stored in a mySQL database. 
Used JSP and JSTL for the view and Servlet as the controller.
